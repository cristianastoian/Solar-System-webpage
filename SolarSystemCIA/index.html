It’s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it’s our solar system’s only star. Without the Sun’s energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet.The Sun has been called by many names. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective for all things Sun-related: solar. Helios, the Sun god in ancient Greek mythology, lends his name to many Sun-related terms as well, such as heliosphere and helioseismology.The Sun could not harbor life as we know it because of its extreme temperatures and radiation. Yet life on Earth is only possible because of the Sun’s light and energy.">Sun

   day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip
    as low as -290°F (-180°C).
  Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus,
  thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
  Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we
   know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.">

  data-bs-content="Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.
  Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with
  surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.
  Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most
  features on Venus are named for women. Venus, the third brightest object after the Sun and Moon, was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
    It’s the only planet named after a female god.
  At the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another
  transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly
  intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. ">

  Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology.

  the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere,
  billions of years ago.
  Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it Her Desher,
   meaning the red one.
  Even today, it is frequently called the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to
  look red.Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago,
  when Mars was warmer and covered with water.">

  rolling ball.
  
  
  Uranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he
  originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet,
  in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium
  Sidus after King George III. Instead, the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.">

   In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
  
  
  Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The warm light we see here on
  our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical
  calculations. Using predictions made by Urbain Le Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the
  Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier.">
